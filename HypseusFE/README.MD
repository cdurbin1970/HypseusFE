A new project to create a Front End for the Hypseus Emulator Written in C# Targets .NET 4.8

Uses the AMS.Profile package from Nuget
Uses Fancy Windows Forms found here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33716/Fancy-Windows-Forms

It is very basic right now but I will be adding features as time allows.
